        MEATPLANT (now Masoklove) is "project" that I started in 2021 as a way to express through music my frustration with life and
        clinical depression.
        However, I want MEATPLANT to be more than that. I'm not entirely sure what, and I don't think I could define it
        beyond "a project for some of my art".
        What kind of art? mostly music and pictures. maybe a short story here or there and some zines.
        MEATPLANT is more of an undefined theme for myself more than anything.
        <br>
        Not everything on this website is explicitly MEATPLANT related.
        Some of it is just stuff I make that I want to put somewhere for others to see for whatever reason.
        <br>
        There is also some fun hidden stuff on this site. I won't elaborate further
        <br>
        Thanks for visiting! -Meaty
